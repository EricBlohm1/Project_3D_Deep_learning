The final notebook for reconstruction is: /VoxNet/VoxNet\_recon\_latent512\_skip.ipynb and the autoencoder without skip connections are given in /VoxNet/VoxNet\_recon.ipynb  

The notebooks for classification are: /VoxNet/VoxNet\_classification.ipynb and /PointNet/PointNet\_cls.ipynb

The utils notebook is for downloading the dataset, and precomputing the voxel grids.

Finally, the neural network models are given in the python files.
